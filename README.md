Nolat-Launchy
=============

![Minimal Dark Theme](https://raw.github.com/Talon876/nolat-launchy/master/gallery/nolat-dark.png)

Usage
-----
To use the skins, just put the folders located in `/skins` into your Launchy skins directory.

Alternatively, open a powershell window as an admin and run `.\deploy.ps1`

Fonts
-----
This skin uses both Segoe UI and Segoe WP, both of which come with Windows 8; however, these fonts are not distributable. If you'd like to use another font, modify the `style.qss` file in the skin you wish to change and replace the Segoe family with a similar family.
